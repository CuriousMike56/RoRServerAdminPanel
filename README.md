# Rigs of Rods Server Admin Panel - RoRNet 2.38

This is a webpanel for Rigs of Rods servers, originally developed by Neorej16 (Original repo [Here](https://github.com/Strykr1/rormpservadmin)).

Fixes by [Zentro](https://github.com/officerzentro).

Requires Python 2.7.3+Apache2+PHP+PHP extensions. Check the `phpinstalls.txt` file inside the `daemon` folder for more info. I am not sure which extensions are actually required, but these are the packages installed on my Linux server. So installing all of these should be enough.
